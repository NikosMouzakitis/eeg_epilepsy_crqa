					\begin{description}

					\item[Recurrence Rate (\textbf{RR})]
					The recurrence rate is the simplest measure, defined as the density of recurrence points in the RP. It corresponds to the probability that a state recurs and is analogous to the correlation sum.
					\[
					RR = \frac{1}{N^2} \sum_{i,j=1}^{N} R_{i,j}
					\]

					\item[Determinism (\textbf{DET})]
					Determinism quantifies the percentage of recurrence points that form diagonal lines. Diagonal lines are a signature of deterministic dynamics, where segments of the trajectory run in parallel for some time. A higher DET indicates a more predictable, deterministic system.
					\[
					DET = \frac{\sum_{l=l_{\text{min}}}^{N} l \, P(l)}{\sum_{l=1}^{N} l \, P(l)}
					\]
					where \( P(l) \) is the histogram of diagonal line lengths \( l \), and \( l_{\text{min}} \) is the minimum line length (typically 2).

					\item[Laminarity (\textbf{LAM})]
					Laminarity measures the percentage of recurrence points that form vertical lines. Vertical lines indicate states that do not change or change very slowly for a period (laminar states). It can detect chaos-chaos transitions or intermittency.
					\[
					LAM = \frac{\sum_{v=v_{\text{min}}}^{N} v \, P(v)}{\sum_{v=1}^{N} v \, P(v)}
					\]
					where \( P(v) \) is the histogram of vertical line lengths \( v \), and \( v_{\text{min}} \) is the minimum line length.

					\item[Ratio DET/RR (\textbf{RATIO DET/RR})]
					The ratio is a measure of complexity, calculated as the ratio between DET and RR. It can be sensitive to transitions between order and chaos.
					\[
					RATIO = \frac{N^2 \sum_{l=l_{\text{min}}}^{N} l \, P(l)}{\left( \sum_{l=1}^{N} l \, P(l) \right)^2}
					\]

					\item[Average Diagonal Line Length (\textbf{L})]
					This metric represents the average time that two segments of the trajectory remain close, providing an estimate of the mean prediction time.
					\[
					L = \frac{\sum_{l=l_{\text{min}}}^{N} l \, P(l)}{\sum_{l=l_{\text{min}}}^{N} P(l)}
					\]

					\item[Trapping Time (\textbf{TT})]
					Trapping time is the average length of vertical lines, quantifying the mean time the system remains trapped in a specific state (laminarity in time).
					\[
					TT = \frac{\sum_{v=v_{\text{min}}}^{N} v \, P(v)}{\sum_{v=v_{\text{min}}}^{N} P(v)}
					\]

					\item[Longest Diagonal Line (\textbf{L$_{\text{max}}$})]
					The length of the longest diagonal line in the RP is related to the Lyapunov exponent of the system. A shorter \( L_{\text{max}} \) suggests a faster divergence of trajectories, which is a hallmark of chaos.
					\[
					L_{\text{max}} = \max(\{l_i \; | \; i=1,\ldots,N_l\})
					\]

					\item[Divergence (\textbf{DIV})]
					Divergence is the inverse of \( L_{\text{max}} \). It is related to the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy and the sum of the positive Lyapunov exponents, providing a measure of how quickly nearby trajectories diverge.
					\[
					DIV = \frac{1}{L_{\text{max}}}
